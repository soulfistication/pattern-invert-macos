## Pattern Invert

Pattern invert for MacOS is a SwiftUI native application used for showing a basic visual stimulus for recording EEG in subjects.
For now the stimulus is just a checkered board that is inverted every second (it's configurable in code in Config file). 
There is a small red dot in the center of the screen for the subject to focus on. The app is meant to be run on MacOS in fullscreen.

After the number of stimulus (configurable in the Config file) is reached the screen turns to black.

This application was developed for replicating an experiment by Jacobo Grinberg in which we recorded the EEG of a couple of subjects (on different rooms) for a duration
of minute and a half while showing them this visual stimulii after meditation.

I would like to thank to Leah Bella Attie for supporting this project.
